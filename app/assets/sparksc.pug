            p.fancy-body <b>Praxis</b> is one of my favorite words. It comes from the Greek <em>pratten</em>, for <b>doing</b> â€” it is the translation of idea into action, or idea to impact.
            
            p.fancy-body I was first exposed to this idea through Spark, a student organization at USC. Spark's official mission is to

            p.fancy-body I have also been an organizing member of our speaker series team, thousand-person pitch competition, student-run product-design class, and a retired art festival initiative.
